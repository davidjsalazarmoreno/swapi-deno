    <p class="max-w-xs">
      The Star Wars API, or "swapi" (Swah-pee) is the world's first quantified
      and programmatically-accessible data source for all the data from the Star
      Wars canon universe! SWAPI Deno is just a clone of a swapi subset just for
      fun.

    <h2 class="text-center font-bold mb-5">How can I use it?</h2>
    <p class="max-w-xs">
      This project is not intented to be consumed as API, instead is just an
      invitation for you to check the repo and practice Deno, Svelte and
      Tailwind.
